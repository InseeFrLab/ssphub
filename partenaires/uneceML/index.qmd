title: UNECE ML Group
description: |
  The research work of the ML Group is divided into 5 Work Streams (WS) that aimed to address different issues that arise when using machine learning for official statistics (see “ML Group 2021 Work Streams Outputs” below for more information for each work stream and outputs). The monthly ML Group meetings throughout the year has built a community where members can share experiences, build connections and keep up to date with the new developments (see “ML Group 2021 Monthly Meeting Presentations” below for more information).
