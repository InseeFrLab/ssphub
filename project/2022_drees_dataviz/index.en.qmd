# Project summary

|  | Automatic publication and data-visualisation of Covid-19 test data      |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | In recent years, the `DREES` (the statistical department of the Ministry of Health), has been making available, as part of its strategy *open-data* as part of its open-data strategy, is making available interactive visualisations of data on a variety of topics (Covid, of course, but also the number of healthcare professionals, pensions and retirement ages, etc.).  These visualisations are based on {{< fa brands r-project >}} `Shiny` and give users the freedom to play with the data and update exploratory graphs. <br> Between October 2020 and June 2023,3 DREES provided data on the volume and validation times for RT-PCR and antigen tests on a weekly basis. These results are based on data from the SI-DEP information system.           |
