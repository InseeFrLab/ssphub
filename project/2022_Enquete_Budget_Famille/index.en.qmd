| **Details of the project** | The collection of the next Family Budget survey in 2026 will be very different from that of the previous survey (2017). <br> - In fact, some of the household consumption data will be collected through a **mobile application** made available to the households surveyed. <br> - In addition, the products derived from the consumption data will no longer be recorded in the database by the interviewers, but by a data entry or automatic extraction service provider. <br> There are two main strands to this experiment: <br>  - The first involves testing open-source solutions from**automatic extraction of the contents of till receipts** in order to be able to work more effectively with partners such as Teklia and potentially carry out some of the extraction work in-house; <br> - The second (main) axis is around the **automatic coding of consumer products in the COICOP nomenclature** nomenclature: training of a classification model on data from the previous survey and development of an optimal recovery strategy.                                                                      |
