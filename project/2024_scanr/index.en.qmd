# Project summary

|  | Explore the world of French Research and Innovation with scanR|
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | scanR is a **web application to help characterise public structures** (research units of all types, public institutions) and private structures (companies) involved in research and innovation in France. scanR also helps to identify the **the direction of the work of researchers active in France** since the early 1990s. <br> <br> scanR combines structured data under an open licence (publications and theses, participation in collaborative research projects, spin-offs, patents, etc.) and open information extracted directly from the websites of research and innovation players. This information comes from around 13 different sources (theses.fr, the [open science barometer](../2022_bso/index.qmd) HAL, European Commission, INPI, ANR, European Patent Office, etc.) and is obtained by webscraping, pdf-mining or using APIs. The resources are then identified and linked together, in particular using AI methods, and then enriched. <br> A **engine based on ElasticSearch** allows you to search for themes, structures or authors. <br> Finally, a **feedback loop** to improve the quality of the data produced has been introduced, with the possibility of requesting data corrections from the scanR site. <br> Finally, it is now possible to visually display interactions between different structures or themes using a **network analysis**.|

| **Project results** | - The project provides **files by structure and authors** presenting their organisation, activity, areas of research and source of funding. <br> - It also offers a **search engine** on research structures, authors, funding, publications and patents in France. <br> - It also provides **tools for analysing results** including graph visualisations. <br> The project also provides **several APIs** to retrieve data and data. <br> The scanR project has been in production since 2016. A v2 went live in 2020 and a v3 in 2024. The site records around 50,000 monthly visits.|
| **Project products and documentation** | scanR is a website [scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr). This site includes : <br> - a search engine for the various products of research and innovation in France ; <br> - the [documentation](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/docs/overview) to access the four APIs available ; <br> - the various [data sources](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/about/resources) used for the project. <br> <br> - Detailed technical presentation of scanR [*scanR - Explore public data on French research and innovation*](https://hal.science/hal-04813230v1) euroCRIS conference, November 2024; <br> - [Mapping scientific communities at scale](https://hal.science/hal-04892262v1)|
