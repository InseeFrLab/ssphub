# Project summary

|  | Explore the world of French Research and Innovation with scanR|
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | scanR is a web application to help characterise the public (research units of all types, public institutions) and private (companies) structures involved in research and innovation in France. scanR also helps to identify the orientations of the work of researchers active in France since the early 1990s. <br> scanR combines structured data under open licence (publications and theses, participation in collaborative research projects, spin-offs, patents, etc.) and open information extracted directly from the websites of those involved in research and innovation. This information comes from around 13 different sources (theses.fr, the [open science barometer](../2022_bso/index.qmd) HAL, European Commission, INPI, ANR, European Patent Office, etc.). <br> Based on this information, scanR produces fact sheets presenting the contribution to research and innovation in France of tens of thousands of researchers and nearly 60,000 companies, organisations, higher education establishments and public laboratories. <br> Finally, through its search engine based on ElasticSearch, scanR helps its users to identify the players and researchers active in France associated with a research problem.|
| **Players** | Statistical Service of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research ([SIES](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/sies)) |
| **Project results** | The project provides **files by structure and authors** presenting their organisation, activity, areas of research and source of funding.  It also provides a **search engine** on research structures, authors, funding, publications and patents in France. It also provides **tools for analysing results** including graph visualisations. The project also provides a number of APIs for retrieving data. <br> The scanR project has been in production since 2016. A v2 was put into production in 2020 and a v3 in 2024.|
| **Project products and documentation** | scanR is a website [scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr). This site includes : <br> - a search engine for the various products of research and innovation in France ; <br> - the [documentation](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/docs/overview) to access the four APIs available; <br> - the various [data sources](https://scanr.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/about/resources) used for the project.|
| **Project code** | - The code is available on GitHub {{< fa brands github >}} <https://github.com/dataesr/scanr-ui>|
