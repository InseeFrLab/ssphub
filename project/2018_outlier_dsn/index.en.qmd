# Project summary

|  | Use of machine learning methods to detect and process outliers or missing values, application to the Social Nominative Declarations (Déclaration Sociale Nominative) |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | As part of the modernisation of INSEE's internal processes following the Social Nominative Declarations entry into production, this project aims to rethink anomaly detection and salary adjustment. The management of new monthly DSN data has led to the testing of machine learning methods to automatically detect anomalies in the triplet of variables (gross salary, net salary and number of hours). |
| **Players** | Insee |
| **Project results** | The work carried out has made it possible to compare the characteristics of the anomalies identified by three machine learning methods. The three algorithms largely detect different anomalies, depending on how they define and identify the presumed errors. The combined use of several error detection algorithms would therefore make it possible to cover a wider spectrum of potential errors. <br> The results of the project were presented at JMS 2018 [5,324 per hour: outlier or footballer? Unsupervised learning methods for anomaly detection: application to the case of the Nominative Social Declaration (mixed French and English)](https://journees-methodologie-statistique.insee.net/5324-euros-de-lheure-outlier-ou-footballeur-methodes-dapprentissage-non-supervise-pour-la-detection-danomalies-application-au-cas-de-la-declaration-sociale-nominative/).
