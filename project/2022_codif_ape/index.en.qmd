# Project summary

|  | Automatic coding of companies' main activity                                      | 
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | The coding of companies' main activity (APE) on the basis of activity descriptions (in the form of free text) in the Sirene register was previously carried out using 6 deterministic coding environments mobilising a huge number of decision rules. The aim of the experiment is to **test the performance of statistical learning models in predicting the category of APE** category as part of the overhaul of the Sirene register and the introduction of a one-stop shop. <br> | 
| **Players** | Insee                         | 
| **Project results** | The model developed presents **similar performance to previous models** by automating them, and also offers decision support. The model has also been put into production, applying MLOps principles where possible. <br> Presentations and written materials relating to the project can be accessed at [this site](https://inseefrlab.github.io/codif-ape-prez/). | 
| **Project code** | Accessible code repositories [here](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AInseeFrLab%20codif-ape&type=repositories&p=1). They include: <br> - Code for annotating data using Label Studio ; <br> - Code for a coding web API deployed on the SSP Cloud ; <br> - Code implementing a visualisation dashboard for monitoring the activity of a coding model in production and accessible via a web API; <br> - Code for training APE classification models. <br> |
