# Project summary

|  | Using satellite images for official statistics       |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | At the end of 2022, an experimental working group on the use of satellite data for official statistics was launched. The aim of this initiative was to **improve the organisation of mapping surveys in overseas departments** particularly in French Guiana and Mayotte. These surveys are used to update the individual/housing register (RIL) each year, and make it easier to identify new spontaneous or temporary housing areas in advance of the surveys. Algorithms applied to **satellite photographs** are used to identify such areas, which in a given year will require more surveyors than in the previous year. <br> The project is presented in more detail [here](https://inseefrlab.github.io/satellite-images-docs/src/documentation/index.html).                                               |
| **Actors** | Insee (DG and Réunion-Mayotte Interregional Directorate)                                      |
| **Project results** | The results of the project are presented in more detail [on the dedicated website](https://inseefrlab.github.io/satellite-images-docs/). The experimentation phase ended with: <br> - The transmission of **building evolution statistics** in Mayotte. These statistics were used to organise the 2024 complementary mapping survey in Mayotte; <br> - The development of a [**visualisation application**](https://inseefrlab.github.io/satellite-images-webapp/) integrating background maps built from Pleiades tiles and buildings detected on these tiles using our algorithms, as well as change detection layers; <br> - The creation of the**Python package for processing satellite images** [**Astrovision**](https://pypi.org/project/astrovision/)                                      |
