# Project summary

|  | Construction of an economic sentiment indicator based on press articles to forecast economic growth    |
| --- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project details** | The information produced by the media is reactive, abundant and covers a wide range of economic fields. In addition, text analysis (text mining) and automated online data collection (webscraping) techniques can be used to develop indicators that summarise this wealth of information. The aim of the experiment is to estimate the added value of a media indicator associated with economic activity by complementing existing business surveys. This experiment complements pre-existing work, which is seeking to construct an indicator to help predict GDP on the basis of the archives of the newspaper Le Monde, by mobilising complementary journalistic sources and reviewing the models used. |
| **Players** | Insee    |
| **Project results** | An indicator of current media sentiment was constructed on the basis of the tone of press articles. |
