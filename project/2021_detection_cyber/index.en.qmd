# Project summary

|  | Detecting cybercrime in procedures       |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project details** | Cybercrime is a new and fast-growing form of criminality, and the fight against it is a major challenge for the police and gendarmerie. However, it is proving particularly difficult to quantify. It covers all criminal offences attempted or committed against or mainly using information and communication systems. The nomenclature of offences allows only part of this type of crime to be identified. To obtain a better statistical measure, it is necessary to use information provided in textual areas of procedures. The aim of the experiment is to explore the potential of textual analysis methods on these data to measure the extent of this type of crime. |
| **Players** | INSEE and the Ministerial Statistical Office (MSO) for Internal Security ([SSMSI](https://www.police-nationale.interieur.gouv.fr/nous-decouvrir/notre-organisation/organisation/service-statistique-ministeriel-de-securite))       |
| **Project results** | The work was taken up by the SSMSI to derive a two-dimensional nomenclature of cyber-related offences. The algorithm predicts more than 95% of offences as falling within the definition of cybercrime. Similarly, it predicts less than 1% of offences as not falling within the scope of cybercrime as defined. |
