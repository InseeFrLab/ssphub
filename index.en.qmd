# Network of data scientists working for the French Official Statistical Office

This website is made for the `SSPHub`, a network to foster collaboration and exchange among *data scientists* from the [French Official Statistical Office](https://www.insee.fr/en/information/2386424). Indeed, in France, the French Official Statistical Office is decentralized :

-   INSEE has its headquarters in Paris region but also has a network of regional offices.

-   The other part of the French Officiel Statistical Office is composed of INSEE and 16 Ministerial Statistical Offices (MSOs). MSOs carry out statistical operations in their field of competence.

-   INSEE coordinates the public statistics production work of the various MSOs.

The English version of the website aims at sharing code and innovative projects produced by the *data scientists* from the [French Official Statistical Office](https://www.insee.fr/en/information/2386424).

The French version of the website offers broader resources to *data scientists* (newsletter, courses ... ). As it has limited value added for people outside of the French administration, it has not been translated. But, if you're interested🙂, you are more than welcome to have a look (by using automated translation tools).

Find out more information about the `SSPHub` network on the [dedicated page](about.qmd).
