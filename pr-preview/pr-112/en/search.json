    "text": "Project summary\n\n\n\n\nAn assessment of cross-border tobacco purchases and associated tax losses in France\n\n\n\n\nProject details\nSmoking is a major public health problem, causing many preventable diseases worldwide. In recent decades, increasing the price of tobacco has become the main strategy used by governments to reduce smoking. However, price differences between certain neighbouring countries are likely to limit the effectiveness of this measure by allowing some consumers to buy tobacco at a lower price in a neighbouring country. Although the problem of cross-border shopping is not new, the extent of the phenomenon remains poorly understood and is still the subject of regular debate. This study contributes to its assessment in France by exploiting an unprecedented natural experiment : the closure of land borders between March 2020 and June 2020 as part of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nResults show that the closure of the borders led to a 9.5 % surplus in tobacco purchases in mainland France compared to the counterfactual situation in which the borders had remained open. This result probably underestimates cross-border purchases. In fact, some tobacco consumption abroad may have continued during the first lockdown, as the borders were not completely closed, in particular for cross-border workers. Extrapolating the consumption observed in the rest of the country to border regions with identical characteristics, the revenue generated in France would be about 13.5 % higher if there were no cheaper alternatives abroad.\n\n\nProject products and documentation\n- An assessment of cross-border tobacco purchases and associated tax losses in France Insee Working Papers No. 2024-06, April 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological work on the Family Budget survey\n\n\n\nautomatic coding\n\ndata extraction\n\nscanner data\n\n\n\nModernisation of the family budget survey using automatic classification tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnriching case data with nutritional information to analyse the impact of consumption on health\n\n\n\nmachine learning\n\nInsee\n\nCOICOP\n\nscanner data\n\nmatching\n\nexperiment stopped\n\nfasttext\n\nautomatic coding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing credit card data and mobile phone data to forecast economic activity\n\n\n\nforecasts\n\nexperiment\n\nInsee\n\ncredit card data\n\nmobile phone data\n\n\n\nThe 2020 health crisis required a review of forecasting processes to be more responsive to events.

It facilitates, broadens and accelerates the dissemination of the results of research to scientific communities and to society in general: teachers, students, companies, associations, public policy actors, etc.   The French Open Science Monitor thus constructs open science indicators for publications, data, software and codes in order to measure the achievement of this objective.  As far as publications are concerned, as much metadata as possible is collected. It is then filtered to keep only French affiliations and enriched to track the open status of publications by identified discipline. The data is then published as open data. This method makes it possible to create the most exhaustive database of French publications in the world.  For data, software and codes, the scientific production is first listed. The text of the publication is then analysed to detect the availability of open access data, software or codes.

    "text": "Project summary\n\n\n\n\nOnline job vacancies, a new source of labour market data\n\n\n\n\nProject details\nIn just a few years, the Internet has become a new source of information on the job market. According to the Dares Job Offer and Recruitment survey (Ofer), 95% of job advertisements were published on the Internet in 2016, compared with 53% in 2005. With this in mind, Dares decided to collect online job offers published on around fifteen websites to create a new database of job offers: Jocas (Job offers collection and analysis system). Various tools are being used to build this new database: webscraping, automatic text classification algorithms and de-duplication.  For 2019, the Jocas database can be compared with the usual sources of public statistics on job vacancies, whether administrative sources, such as vacancies advertised by Pôle emploi and Declarations Préliminaires à l’embauche (DPAE) from Urssaf, or data from surveys such as Pôle emploi’s “Besoins en main-d’œuvre” (BMO), INSEE’s “Emploi” survey, and DARES’ “Activité et conditions d’emploi de la main-d’œuvre” (Acemo) survey. The results show that Jocas covers occupations unevenly. Occupations with a high proportion of managerial staff or that recruit a lot of people online tend to be over-represented. Conversely, those with a high proportion of multiple recruitments or using informal recruitment channels tend to be under-represented.\n\n\nPlayers\nDARES\n\n\nProject results\nOnline vacancy data has been used to calculate tensions on the labour market. They were also used to produce the table monitoring the labour market situation in 2020-2021 during the Covid-19 crisis. Jocas data is freely accessible to students, researchers and civil servants. Access to the data may also be granted for statistical and non-commercial use, on request from DARES.

It tracks a certain number of identical products over time. When these disappear, they are replaced by products that may not be equivalent. In this case, it is important to distinguish between a quality effect (price difference for a given month) and an inflation effect in the change in prices of the replacements compared with the products replaced.  Hedonic” methods estimate this quality effect on the basis of coefficients corresponding to the underlying prices of the various technical characteristics of the product (for example, the brand of computer, the RAM of a computer, the model and frequency of the processor, etc.). The aim of the project is to strengthen these methods of estimating the quality effect by extending the database and using statistical learning methods.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nThe study made it possible to increase the samples used (in terms of price surveys and characteristics) by collecting data online (webscraping) and to set up a procedure for automatically selecting the characteristics that explain prices using automatic learning (random forest, Lasso-type regression).  Ultimately, 15 characteristics were selected to estimate the quality effect, such as brand, RAM, storage capacity, brand of processor, processor frequency, screen resolution, etc. The forms used by the surveyors have been amended to include the relevant characteristics that determine the price of computers."

For each barcode, each day and each point of sale, till data gives the quantities sold as well as the turnover and/or the price at which the product was sold. To use this data, however, you need to know which product is behind a barcode. Currently, the IPC relies on a barcode repository, purchased from a service provider, which provides very detailed and structured information on the characteristics of these products. This information is subject to a charge and does not cover all products. The aim of the experiment is to identify the steps involved in textual processing of the labels, as well as the classification or other methods that would enable the labels to be coded automatically, without going through the repository, in the Coicop nomenclature for the IPC and on the groupings used for Emagsa as part of the Nosica project, which aims to integrate cashier data into the production of short-term activity indicators.

The aim of this project is to make the best possible use of the most recent sources to estimate the dynamics of the major macroeconomic aggregates over the last few weeks. These sources are diverse in nature: business and consumer surveys, quarterly national accounts, hard-copy statistical data, as well as data from less traditional sources (internet searches, etc.).   Using this heterogeneous set of data, the tool produces a growth forecast for the macroeconomic aggregates that are most closely scrutinised for French economic conditions (GDP, household consumption, investment, etc.). This forecast is made for the current quarter or the following quarters, based on models of machine learning (LASSO, random forests, etc.).   The tool was initially developed for a Business conditions in 2019. Following the health crisis, it was taken up again for more systematic use. Initially focused on France and only on GDP for the current quarter, it has been extended to other countries (Germany, Italy, Spain) and is currently being extended to aggregates other than GDP and to more distant forecasting horizons.\n\n\nStakeholders\nInsee\n\n\nProject products and documentation\n- Continuous forecasting of French growth1, Conjoncture in France - December 2019"

Social and spatial segregation indices are constructed using the frequency of interactions between each operator’s customers. These synthetic indicators provide a picture of social segregation, its level and its evolution over time - on a weekly and calendar year basis. The indices also make it possible to measure the propensity to communicate more strongly within the same social group, defined by an income criterion, or on the contrary a strong interaction between several social groups. In particular, this makes it possible to measure the contrast in the behaviour of extreme social groups. The segregation profile revealed by the mobile telephony data is compared with existing literature on the subject.

    "text": "What is considered as an innovative project?\nIt is always difficult to define ex ante what constitutes an innovative project. Technological innovation is by definition fluid and evolves very quickly. However, as stated in the manifesto (in French), recent technological innovations aim to simplify and accelerate certain production processes, facilitate the exploitation of non-traditional or large data sources, automate certain tasks, communicate with wider audiences using responsive visualisations, and, among other things, reduce the gap between statisticians and computer scientists. For example, modernising a processing chain through the use of new packages or new methods of information processing is an innovation. However, this may not be ambitious enough on its own to constitute a truly innovative project, and therefore will not necessarily be included in the projects presented here. The use of web scraping to build a database that is automatically populated will be considered an innovative project. Conversely, simply updating code or using new administrative databases, if it does not involve any particular technological obstacles, is not considered technological innovation in itself. This does not mean that such a project is unnecessary or unwelcome 😉.\nFurthermore, a project that is innovative at a given point in time may no longer be so a few months or years later, when the innovation has become widespread enough to be considered conventional knowledge.\nInnovation also occurs everywhere and is not limited to various data science innovation laboratories."

Some associations are registered in Sirène (as employers, subsidised organisations, etc.) but 50% of them have an APE code of 9499Z, which makes it impossible to determine their field of activity precisely. Associations governed by the 1901 Act are registered in the National Directory of Associations (RNA), managed by the Ministry of the Interior. In this directory, a “corporate purpose” field filled in plain text quickly describes the activities of each association. The aim of the experiment is to analyse this field textually in order to predict the activity in 10 modalities.  In practice, after pre-processing and exploration of the textual data and its themes (Dirichlet latent allocation), a dictionary of words was compiled, with variants to reduce its size. The actual prediction was based on various supervised learning models (random forests, support vector machine, penalised generalised linear models GLMnet and Extrem Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)), with the training set (and test sets) being provided by the previous survey (2014) matched with the RNA. The XGboost model performed better than the others (with precision and recall of the order of 69%). The best model is obtained by combining the different models tested.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nThe sample for the Association survey was drawn according to a stratification process taking advantage of the prediction of the sector of activity by machine learning carried out as part of this experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar projects related to automatic coding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological work on the Family Budget survey\n\n\nModernisation of the family budget survey using automatic classification tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJocas, webscraping online job offers\n\n\nThe project Jocas (Job offers collection and analysis system) project enables the DARES (Ministerial Statistical Office for Labour) to automatically collect job offers…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnriching case data with nutritional information to analyse the impact of consumption on health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic coding of companies’ main activity\n\n\nDevelop a machine learning algorithm to automate the classification of companies’ main activities and put it into production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic coding of occupations in the PCS 2020 nomenclature\n\n\nAutomatically code occupations as part of the switch to the new PCS nomenclature (PCS 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of checkout data using machine learning\n\n\nUsing machine learning to classify scanner data in the COICOP nomenclature to calculate the CPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Project summary\n\n\n\n\nUsing credit card and mobile phone data to forecast economic activity\n\n\n\n\nProject details\nThe March 24, 2020 Economic Outlook, prepared by INSEE during the first quarter of 2020, was never published in its original form. The health crisis and the measures taken to limit the spread of the pandemic, starting with containment, have turned standard economic forecasts on their head and necessitated the use of alternative, more responsive sources. Traditional data, available for the most part on a monthly basis, were unable to provide reliable and relevant information on the economic situation within the time available: for example, the most recent business surveys, which are a key source for forecasting, were collected mainly between the end of February and the beginning of March, i.e. before the first containment was announced. The first quantitative indicators for March, based on surveys or administrative sources, were not available until April or May. INSEE therefore mobilised other sources of data, of various kinds although essentially high frequency, such as supermarket scanner data, rail freight, mobile phone data, electricity consumption, internet use, and credit card transaction data.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nThe use of aggregated and anonymised credit card transaction data to monitor economic activity and household consumption proved particularly appropriate and relevant in 2020, when measures were put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. They will make it possible to document in real time an exceptional shock for which the standard measurement tools appeared late or sometimes unsuitable. The wealth of information available leads to particularly diverse analyses. However, these sources present significant conceptual differences with the usual statistics used to monitor economic activity. Failure to take them into account would lead to distorted analyses, both in terms of levels and trends. Mobile phone data was also used to track the return to normal activity during the lifting of lockdown restrictions in June 2020. The relevance of these private sources for public studies therefore depends largely on the degree of granularity of the information available and the ability of the producer and user to converge towards a common framework.\n\n\nProject products and documentation\n- What do bankcard transaction data have to say about the behaviour of ‘confined’ consumers?

The experimental data were published in 2021.  Taking advantage of the few days between the announcement of the containment and its entry into force, the population was able to choose where to spend this period. Based on private mobile phone data, which INSEE was already working on, INSEE estimated that around 1.5 million metropolitan residents had returned to their home département and that Paris had lost around 450,000 metropolitan residents compared with the first few months of 2020, half of whom were usual Paris residents. These population surpluses were widely distributed throughout France. In general (apart from Paris), the population was closer to its usual place of residence during the confinement: the reasons for overnight stays in other regions, such as tourism, family visits or business trips, were severely restricted.  A year later, a richer dataset was published by INSEE using the same method to visualise overnight stays aggregated by place of residence, comparing the period before and after the confinement.

However, the autocomplete tool will only be available for computerised data collection, and moreover it includes the possibility of answering “off-list”. In order to be able to integrate the new 2020 PCS into the population census for the 2024 collection and also to be able to code paper ballots as well as computerised “off-list” responses, a automatic coding algorithm in PCS 2020 of these ballots must be created. Following the postponement of the 2021 census survey, managers have annotated in PCS 2020, with double coding and arbitration, 119,000 bulletins from the EAR 2020. The aim of the experiment is to test and compare different statistical learning models and pre-processing methods for coding occupations in the PCS 2020 nomenclature on the basis of the occupation wording and ancillary variables used during the annotation phase (employer status, etc.), and to select the best performing model. The aim is to maintain the rate of correct codings and the rate of manual data transmission at levels similar to the current situation.\n\n\nStakeholders\nInsee\n\n\nProject products and documentation\n- Application of machine learning techniques to code occupations in the nomenclature of occupations and socio-professional categories 2020, 2022 Statistical Methodology Days (Journées de méthodologie statistique 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological work on the Family Budget survey\n\n\nModernisation of the family budget survey using automatic classification tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJocas, webscraping online job offers\n\n\nThe project Jocas (Job offers collection and analysis system) project enables the DARES (Ministerial Statistical Office for Labour) to automatically collect job offers…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnriching case data with nutritional information to analyse the impact of consumption on health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic coding of companies’ main activity\n\n\nDevelop a machine learning algorithm to automate the classification of companies’ main activities and put it into production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassification of checkout data using machine learning\n\n\nUsing machine learning to classify scanner data in the COICOP nomenclature to calculate the CPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jan 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic coding of association activity\n\n\nAutomatic coding of association activity using machine learning methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Jun 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

In order to improve the index and overcome some of the limitations of the current method, this project is exploring an innovative collection method, the webscraping from a booking site.  Once the data has been collected online, it is raw and needs to be cleaned up: for example, the value for a characteristic is not necessarily described in the same way between two observations. To overcome the problems associated with a fixed basket index, the final index is constructed from homogeneous classes.

Checkout data could provide a very rich description of local consumption, provided that product identifiers allow enrichment with external sources, such as nutritional information. The aim of this project is to enrich supermarket data with nutritional information extracted from Open Food Facts, supplemented by Ciqual data from Anses.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nTo compensate for the partial matching via the barcode, a method for efficiently matching short labels was implemented. After a pre-processing stage to normalise short labels, fuzzy matching techniques are implemented. These are based on several tokenizers (including n-grams) by querying an ElasticSearch custom index and validating candidate echoes with a Levenstein distance. The pipeline consists of several stages successively relaxing constraints to find relevant candidates. Finally, the final match is evaluated using a similarity measure based on word embedding obtained by training a Siamese network on the exact match via barcodes.

The aim of this initiative was to improve the organisation of mapping surveys in overseas departments particularly in French Guiana and Mayotte. These surveys are used to update the individual/housing register (RIL) each year, and make it easier to identify new spontaneous or temporary housing areas in advance of the surveys. Algorithms applied to satellite photographs are used to identify such areas, which in a given year will require more surveyors than in the previous year.  The project is presented in more detail here.\n\n\nActors\nInsee (DG and Réunion-Mayotte Interregional Directorate)\n\n\nProject results\nThe results of the project are presented in more detail on the dedicated website. The experimentation phase ended with:  - The transmission of building evolution statistics in Mayotte. These statistics were used to organise the 2024 complementary mapping survey in Mayotte;  - The development of a visualisation application integrating background maps built from Pleiades tiles and buildings detected on these tiles using our algorithms, as well as change detection layers;  - The creation of thePython package for processing satellite images Astrovision\n\n\nProject code\n- https://github.com/InseeFrLab/astrovision : Python package package for working with satellite data:  - https://inseefrlab.github.io/satellite-images-webapp/ code of theviewing application  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-preprocess code of data pre-processing  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-train code for themodel training  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-inference code for theinference\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments relating to the INSEE satellite data project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n         \n        \n          \n            Conference on New Techniques and Technologies for official Statistics (NTTS 2025)\n            \n\n            \n              Description : Slide deck for the NTTS 2025 conference.\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n              \n                Raya Berova, Thomas Faria et Clément Guillo\n                12 Mar 2025\n              \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n\n      \n     \n  \n\n  \n     \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n         \n        \n          \n            AIML4OS Workshop on Earth Observation\n            \n\n            \n              Description : Slideshow presentation of the project Detecting changes in buildings in French overseas departments for Work Package 7,\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Official Statistics, organized by Eurostat.\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n              \n                Raya Berova, Thomas Faria et Clément Guillo\n                13 Nov 2024\n              \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n\n      \n     \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\nSimilar projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoremifasol\n\n\nThe package  Doremifasol makes it easier for data scientists to retrieve Insee data.
