The aim of this initiative was to improve the organisation of mapping surveys in overseas departments particularly in French Guiana and Mayotte. These surveys are used to update the individual/housing register (RIL) each year, and make it easier to identify new spontaneous or temporary housing areas in advance of the surveys. Algorithms applied to satellite photographs are used to identify such areas, which in a given year will require more surveyors than in the previous year.  The project is presented in more detail here.\n\n\nActors\nInsee (DG and Réunion-Mayotte Interregional Directorate)\n\n\nProject results\nThe results of the project are presented in more detail on the dedicated website. The experimentation phase ended with:  - The transmission of building evolution statistics in Mayotte. These statistics were used to organise the 2024 complementary mapping survey in Mayotte;  - The development of a visualisation application integrating background maps built from Pleiades tiles and buildings detected on these tiles using our algorithms, as well as change detection layers;  - The creation of thePython package for processing satellite images Astrovision\n\n\nProject code\n- https://github.com/InseeFrLab/astrovision : Python package package for working with satellite data:  - https://inseefrlab.github.io/satellite-images-webapp/ code of theviewing application  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-preprocess code of data pre-processing  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-train code for themodel training  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/satellite-images-inference code for theinference\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments relating to the INSEE satellite data project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n         \n        \n          \n            Conference on New Techniques and Technologies for official Statistics (NTTS 2025)\n            \n\n            \n              Description : Slide deck for the NTTS 2025 conference.\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n              \n                Raya Berova, Thomas Faria et Clément Guillo\n                12 Mar 2025\n              \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n\n      \n     \n  \n\n  \n     \n      \n        \n          \n            \n          \n         \n        \n          \n            AIML4OS Workshop on Earth Observation\n            \n\n            \n              Description : Slideshow presentation of the project Detecting changes in buildings in French overseas departments for Work Package 7,\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Official Statistics, organized by Eurostat.\n\n            \n\n            \n            \n              \n                Raya Berova, Thomas Faria et Clément Guillo\n                13 Nov 2024\n              \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n\n        \n\n      \n     \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items"

There are two main strands to this experiment:  - The first involves testing open-source solutions fromautomatic extraction of the contents of till receipts in order to be able to work more effectively with partners such as Teklia and potentially carry out some of the extraction work in-house;  - The second (main) axis is around the automatic coding of consumer products in the COICOP nomenclature nomenclature: training of a classification model on data from the previous survey and development of an optimal recovery strategy.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee (DSDS)\n\n\nProject results\nProject in progress\n\n\nProject code\n- https://git.lab.sspcloud.fr/ssplab/bdf  - https://git.lab.sspcloud.fr/ssplab/experimentation-bdf"

However, the autocomplete tool will only be available for computerised data collection, and moreover it includes the possibility of answering “off-list”. In order to be able to integrate the new 2020 PCS into the population census for the 2024 collection and also to be able to code paper ballots as well as computerised “off-list” responses, a automatic coding algorithm in PCS 2020 of these ballots must be created. Following the postponement of the 2021 census survey, managers have annotated in PCS 2020, with double coding and arbitration, 119,000 bulletins from the EAR 2020. The aim of the experiment is to test and compare different statistical learning models and pre-processing methods for coding occupations in the PCS 2020 nomenclature on the basis of the occupation wording and ancillary variables used during the annotation phase (employer status, etc.), and to select the best performing model. The aim is to maintain the rate of correct codings and the rate of manual data transmission at levels similar to the current situation.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\n- report on the experiment and results (December 2021)  - paper and presentation at the “statistiques 2022” methodology daysApplication of machine learning techniques to code occupations in the nomenclature of occupations and socio-professional categories 2020”  article and slides presented at the Q2022 Conference “Machine learning for coding occupations in the Census: first lessons from experiments to production”.\n\n\nProject code"

For each barcode, each day and each point of sale, till data gives the quantities sold as well as the turnover and/or the price at which the product was sold. To use this data, however, you need to know which product is behind a barcode. Currently, the IPC relies on a barcode repository, purchased from a service provider, which provides very detailed and structured information on the characteristics of these products. This information is subject to a charge and does not cover all products. The aim of the experiment is to identify the steps involved in textual processing of the labels, as well as the classification or other methods that would enable the labels to be coded automatically, without going through the repository, in the Coicop nomenclature for the IPC and on the groupings used for Emagsa as part of the Nosica project, which aims to integrate cashier data into the production of short-term activity indicators. It is also testing their performance on test data sets.\n\n\nPlayers\nInsee\n\n\nProject results\nCash register data is now used in production to calculate inflation and business activity indicators.  summer 2020 update  progress report winter 2020-2021 \n\n\nProject code\n- https://github.com/InseeFrLab/predicat API for classifying checkout labels  - https://github.com/InseeFrLab/product-labelling : Application for labelling cash register data"
