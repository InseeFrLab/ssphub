summary: |
  The Data Science Competence Center (DSCC) at the Swiss Federal Statistical Office is pleased to invite you to the next webinar in the "Data Science and AI for Public Good" series. This webinar by Dr Salil Vadhan will introduce you to the potential and challenges linked to using differential privacy to open up sensitive data for public good
abstract: |
  Since it was introduced in 2006 by theoretical computer scientists Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith, differential privacy has become the leading framework for ensuring that individual-level information is not leaked through statistical releases or machine learning models built from sensitive datasets.  In addition to a rich theoretical literature, differential privacy has also started to make the transition to practice, with large-scale applications by the US Census Bureau and technology companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta.

  In this talk, Dr Vadhan will survey some of the potential and challenges for using differential privacy to open up sensitive data for public good. In particular, Dr Vadhan will discuss OpenDP, a community effort to build a suite of trustworthy, open-source software tools for deploying differential privacy.
