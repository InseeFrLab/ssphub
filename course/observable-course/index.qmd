title: Cours sur la plateforme de dataviz Observable
description: |
  When do you use a bar chart over a line chart?
  What are area charts good for?
  What's wrong with pie charts?
  Learn about how these different types of data visualization work,
   and how they're used, in Observable's first data visualization course!
  Attend lectures (or watch them later), ask questions, and once you've
  completed a small assignment at the end, you'll earn a certificate.
